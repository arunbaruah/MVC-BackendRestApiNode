Backend NODE, POSTGRES REST API Server functionalities:

         ****Developement *****

1.	Restify is used.   
2.	Postgres is used for data model (schema design).
3.	DB connection information for development and test in config folder.

This is a simple example of REST API in MVC. Professionally we have to include authentication module, unit test etc.

In this Backend, we actually use Controller and Model. View is the UI part.

Please change the Postgres credentials in config folder (config.json)


Start: npm install
